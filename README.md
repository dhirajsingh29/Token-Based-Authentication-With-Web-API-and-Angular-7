# Token-Based-Authentication-With-Web-API-and-Angular-7

There are two parts in this repository.

One being, AuthWithWebApi, containing the Angular code with all the components and services.

Second being, WebAPIProject, containing code of how to register a user and loging him/her in using ASP.NET Identity and Token based authentication.

For understanding I have included a pdf file explaining the different stage of the project.
The pdf file doesn't contain the snapshot of app.module.ts file, but that is a must to be seen, as it shows how to register interceptors.

Load the project in your local. run "npm install" from the path under AuthWithWebApi to get all the neccessary packages.
restore the packages required for WebAPIProject.

After this project is ready to be run.
